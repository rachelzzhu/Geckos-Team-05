## Developer instructions

### Setup

Assuming the Chingu-team-5 repository is already downloaded/cloned to your local machine, perform a `git pull` to make sure everything is up to date.

With the feature/addNodeJS branch checked out, open the terminal and run `npm install`.  This will download all of the project's dependencies into the node_modules folder.

### To run the server

In the terminal run `node server.js` to start up the server. It's configured to run on port 3000. Now open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in order to view the live, locally-hosted website!

Alternatively, you can run `nodemon server.js` which will behave the same as above except it will live-reload when the server.js file is saved. Any HTML & CSS changes you make should be automatically reflected here too.

** Note: Links to static files like image assets and the main.css file should work without issue. Many of the URLs linking to internal pages however still need be updated to `/` for the home page, `/about` for the About page, `/rooms` for the Rooms page and so on.

_The navigation links on the home page have been updated, but not the rest._

*** Another note:  We'll have to carefully merge the most recent updates to the html and CSS into this new structure.  I figure we can do that together during Wednesday's meeting.
